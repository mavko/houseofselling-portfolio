          Hello there, I'm Sebastian Selling
        </h2>
        <p>Love of the craft since I first laid my hands on Photoshop back in 2001, where I spent my days designing forum signatures and gaming wallpapers. As I grew older I competed in e-sports, mostly counter-strike 1.6 (dating myself here) but also world of warcraft - during this time I found that I loved creating compilation videos of my matches, and of my team mates / friends. </p>
        <p>

          he showed me the prototype one day and I responded, in a typical cocky youngster fashion: "That looks like shit, nobody is gonna use that." - and he simply replied "Well, prove that you can do better."

          The rest is history as they say. We spent the next decade building out not only
