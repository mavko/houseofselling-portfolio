          Hello there, I'm Sebastian Selling
        </h2>
        <p>
          Love of the craft since I first laid my hands on Photoshop back in 2001, where I spent my days designing forum signatures and gaming wallpapers. As I grew older I competed in e-sports, mostly counter-strike 1.6 (dating myself here) but also world of warcraft - during this time I found that I loved creating compilation videos of my matches, and of my team mates / friends.
        </p>
        <p>
          As time went on I wondered if I could ever make a living using my creative side, but it seemed far off and not realistic at all. Growing up less well off it was hammered into you to pursue practicalities, "college and stable jobs".
        </p>
        <p>
          However, that mentality never sat right with me, so in my early twenties I tried all kinds of business ideas. I still look back at those days as the golden days where the brutal reality of entrepreneurship still hadn't set in quite yet. More than anything, it set the spark in me - to keep pushing and aim higher - who knows what awaits?
        </p>
        <p>
          Finally in 2012, my brother came to me with the very beginnings of what later became

            appName="ispect app"
          >ispect</LinkPreview>,
          where he showed me the prototype and I responded, in a typical cocky youngster fashion: "That looks like shit, nobody is gonna use that." - and he simply replied "Well, prove that you can do better."
        </p>

        <p className=''>
          The rest is history as they say. We spent the next decade building out not only
          ispect
          but
